# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hi, I am Lorenzo. I am currently finishing my research Masters' degree in cognitive neuroscience, with a thesis project aiming to model engagement states in humans during a perceptual decision-making task. Since Github is very useful for joint coding projects, my supervisor has instructed me to create an account and learn about the Github flow.
